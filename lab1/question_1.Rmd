# Importance and Context

Like many events in the year 2020, the 2020 United States general election was
unprecedented. Occurring during a global pandemic with political polarization 
at an all-time high and the most diverse candidate pool in U.S. history, 
the 2020 election posed new challenges and opportunities for American citizens 
and politicians. One key component that both major political parties utilized 
was appealing to voters and encouraging voter turnout. In order to appeal to 
the correct demographic base, it is helpful to understand who comprises each 
political party. One distinguishing factor could be age. This report uses 
comprehensive data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020 
Time Series Study to analyze the relative ages of voters registered as either 
Republican or Democratic using an unpaired two-sample t-test. Understanding 
age distributions could help politicians target their campaigns to appropriate 
demographics and reach audiences with whom their messages will resonate. 

# Description of Data
The ANES data set contains information from 8,280 pre-election interviews with 
U.S. citizens of voting age. Two variables are particularly relevant for us 
to operationalize the research question:

- `V201018`: `PARTY OF REGISTRATION`

- `V201507x`: `SUMMARY: RESPONDENT AGE`

Each variable takes on both relevant and irrelevant values for 
our study.
For `PARTY OF REGISTRATION`, we are only interested in registered Democrats and 
Republicans, so we remove individuals who identify as independents,
other parties, as well as other non-answers, i.e. "inapplicable," "don't know," and
"refused" to respond. Similarly, for `SUMMARY: RESPONDENT AGE`, we remove people who refused to answer. After these cleanup operations, we are left with only 3,074 observations to work with. Looking at summaries for each variable, the variables are now all in the correct range.

``` {r echo=FALSE}
summary(df)
```

From Figure 1, we can see that the ANES data contains a larger number of Democrats than Republicans, and the age distribution is not very skewed. We also note that ANES cuts off the values for age at 80, so everyone above age 80 is grouped into the "80 or older" group. 
This means the average age shown in the ANES data will underestimate the true 
average age of the participants.

``` {r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distributions of party affiliation and age within the ANES data set", fig.pos='!h', out.extra='', out.width = "75%", fig.align="center"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
 pie(table(df$party), main="Participants Party Affiliation", labels=c('Democrats', 'Republicans')) # error at knit; that's a problem.
hist(df$age, main="Participants Age Distribution", xlab = "age group", ylab = "Number of people")
```


# Most appropriate test
The unpaired two-sample t-test is most appropriate to answer this question.
We are comparing a quantitative, interval variable for two distinct groups of people with no natural pairing between them.
This directs us to an unpaired t-test, and we evaluate the validity of the 
assumptions under the two-sample unpaired t-test:

1. Although the age data does not quite follow a normal distribution as shown in the histogram in Figure 1, the data set is large enough with 3,074 valid observations for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.
Therefore, this data satisfies the normality assumption of the unpaired t-test.

2. Given the sampling frame based on a cross-section of registered addresses across 50 states
and the District of Columbia, we feel the data are sufficiently close to be i.i.d.

3. `SUMMARY: RESPONDENT AGE` is a metric scale variable.

# Test, results and interpretation
For the test itself, we establish the *null hypothesis* to be that the average age
of Democrats ($\mu_D$) and average age of Republicans ($\mu_R$) are the same. The *alternative hypothesis* is that they are not.
Given we have no strong initial inclination in either direction, this should be a two tailed test.

We'll be using the standard $5\%$ significance level.

$H_0: \mu_D=\mu_R \hspace{4 cm} H_a: \mu_D \neq \mu_R \hspace{4 cm} \alpha=0.05$

``` {r}
t.test(age ~ party, data = df)
```

From the test, we have a very small p-value that is much less than our significance level $\alpha$, representing a highly significant result.
This gives us evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative and
believe that the average age of the Democrats and the Republicans are indeed different,
given the data and a 5% significance level. In addition, a 95% confidence interval for the difference of mean between Democrats and Republicans $\mu_D-\mu_R$ is (-4.5312, -2.0965). Meaning we are 95% confident that the true difference lies in this range, implying that
we cannot claim there is no difference in age between the two groups since the value
0 is not in the confidence interval.

Practically, as can be seen in Figure 2, the average age of a Republican is more than 3 years
older than a Democrat.
Plotting the distribution of ages within each group, we observe that Democratic
participants are more evenly distributed between "young" and "old" whereas Republicans are much more skewed towards people above 60. At the same time, there are larger proportion of Democrats in the entire age group between 18 and 50 than Republicans and vice versa for over 50.
Knowing this information could help the Democratic and Republican parties target
their political campaigns. 
For instance, because Republican registered voters are likely to be older than Democratic registered voters, the Republican Party could implement new strategies encouraging older citizens to vote in hopes of increasing their chance at winning the election. Conversely, the Democratic Party could leverage online campaign or social media to increase turnout rate for younger voters.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="The distribution of age differs for each political party we analyze. The dotted lines represent the average age in each respective political party. Average age of Democrats surveyed is 52.5. Average age of Republicans surveyed is 55.9.", fig.pos='!h', out.extra='', out.width = "75%", fig.align="center"}
# Add categorical variable indicating Democratic or Republican

# Find average age in each political party
mean_age <- df %>%
  group_by(party) %>%
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))

# Create density plot showing age distributions of the two parties
ggplot() +
  geom_density(
    data = df, 
    aes(x = age, color = party)) +
  geom_vline(
    data = mean_age, 
    aes(
      xintercept = mean_age, 
      color = party),
    linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("blue2", "red2")) + 
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of ages across political parties", 
    color = 'Party Affiliation')
```

As a quantitative measure of practical significance, we analyze the correlation.
Although political party is a nominal variable, the ANES data set records Democrats as the number 1 and Republicans as 2. Therefore, we can calculate the correlation since these 
qualitative values have been converted to numeric values. We find the correlation
to equal $0.0953$. This number shows a mild correlation between the two variables,
indicating that higher values of age tend to correspond to "higher values" of 
political party, or the Republican party as ANES has recorded the data.
